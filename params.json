{"name":"Transmission PHP","tagline":"PHP Transmission API client","body":"# PHP Transmission API\r\n\r\nThis library provides an interface to the [Transmission](http://transmissionbt.com)\r\nbit-torrent downloader. It provides means to get and remove torrents from\r\nthe downloader as well as adding new torrents to the download queue.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstallation is easy using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"require\": {\r\n        \"kleiram/transmission-php\": \"dev-master\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nUsing the library is as easy as installing it:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\nuse Transmission\\Transmission;\r\n\r\n$transmission = new Transmission();\r\n\r\n// Getting all the torrents currently in the download queue\r\n$torrents = $transmission->all();\r\n\r\n// Getting a specific torrent from the download queue\r\n$torrent = $transmission->get(1);\r\n\r\n// (you can also get a torrent by the hash of the torrent)\r\n$torrent = $transmission->get(/* torrent hash */);\r\n\r\n// Adding a torrent to the download queue\r\n$torrent = $transmission->add(/* path to torrent */);\r\n\r\n// Removing a torrent from the download queue\r\n$torrent = $transmission->get(1);\r\n$torrent->remove();\r\n\r\n// Or if you want to delete all local data too\r\n$torrent->remove(true);\r\n\r\n// You can also get the Trackers that the torrent currently uses\r\n// These are instances of the Transmission\\Model\\Tracker class\r\n$trackers = $torrent->getTrackers();\r\n\r\n// Getting the files downloaded by the torrent are available too\r\n// These are instances of Transmission\\Model\\File\r\n$files = $torrent->getFiles();\r\n\r\n// You can start, stop, verify the torrent and ask the tracker for\r\n// more peers to connect to\r\n$torrent->stop();\r\n$torrent->start();\r\n$torrent->start(true); // Pass true if you want to start the torrent immediatly\r\n$torrent->verify();\r\n$torrent->reannounce();\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo find out which information is contained by the torrent, check\r\n[`Transmission\\Model\\Torrent`](https://github.com/kleiram/transmission-php/tree/master/lib/Transmission/Model/Torrent.php).\r\n\r\nBy default, the library will try to connect to `localhost:9091`. If you want to\r\nconnect to another host or post you can pass those to the constructor of the\r\n`Transmission` class:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\nuse Transmission\\Transmission;\r\n\r\n$transmission = new Transmission('example.com', 33);\r\n\r\n$torrents = $transmission->all();\r\n$torrent  = $transmission->get(1);\r\n$torrent  = $transmission->add(/* path to torrent */);\r\n\r\n// When you already have a torrent, you don't have to pass the client again\r\n$torrent->delete();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to pass the torrent data directly instead of using a file\r\nbut the metadata must be base64-encoded:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n$torrent = $transmission->add(/* base64-encoded metainfo */, true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the Transmission server is secured with a username and password you can\r\nauthenticate using the `Client` class:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\nuse Transmission\\Client;\r\nuse Transmission\\Transmission;\r\n\r\n$client = new Client();\r\n$client->authenticate('username', 'password');\r\n$transmission = new Transmission();\r\n$transmission->setClient($client);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can control the actual Transmission setting. This means\r\nyou can modify the global download limit or change the download directory:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\nuse Transmission\\Transmission;\r\n\r\n$transmission = new Transmission();\r\n$session = $transmission->getSession();\r\n\r\n$session->setDownloadDir('/home/foo/downloads/complete');\r\n$session->setIncompleteDir('/home/foo/downloads/incomplete');\r\n$session->setIncompleteDirEnabled(true);\r\n$session->save();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTesting is done using [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit). To\r\ntest the application, you have to install the dependencies using Composer before\r\nrunning the tests:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php\r\n$ php composer.phar install\r\n$ phpunit --coverage-text\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n    Version     Changes\r\n\r\n    0.1.0       - Initial release\r\n\r\n    0.2.0       - Rewrote the entire public API\r\n\r\n    0.3.0       - Added support for authentication\r\n\r\n    0.4.0       - The library now requires at least PHP 5.3.2\r\n                - Added support for getting files downloaded by torrent\r\n                - Added support for getting trackers used by a torrent\r\n                - Added support for getting peers connected to\r\n                - The torrent now contains:\r\n                    * Whether it is finished\r\n                    * The up- and download rate (in bytes/s)\r\n                    * The size of the download (when completed)\r\n                    * The ETA of the download\r\n                    * The percentage of the download completed\r\n                - Made the authentication more flexible\r\n                - The client now sends an User-Agent header with each request\r\n                - Added support for starting, stopping, veryfing and\r\n                  requesting a reannounce of torrents\r\n\r\n    0.5.0       - Fix a bug in the authentication/authorization mechanism\r\n                - A whole lot of other stuff including management of the\r\n                  Transmission session (setting global download speed limit\r\n                  and toggling the speed limit among others).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis library is licensed under the BSD 2-clause license.\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) 2013, Ramon Kleiss <ramon@cubilon.n>\r\n    All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\n    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n    1.
